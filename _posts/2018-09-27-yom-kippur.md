Because I made this dress, and the infamous hole in it, in the time between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the time of year when the Jewish people ruminate on our own brokenness, fragility, and misdeeds, it seems appropriate to draw on the Yom Kippur liturgy to look for the lesson here. 

On Yom Kippur, there is a recurring theme that God is a craftsman, and having created the humans of the earth, can choose to throw away the imperfect ones, or salvage them. 

While I don’t connect to belief in “God” in anything like a traditional sense, I do feel connected to the writings, teaching, and meaning people, my ancestors, have made over the years. This little nugget, a Piyyut (prayerful poem), is one that seems highly relevant here: 

>“Like the clay in the hand of the potter-he expands it at will and contracts it at will- so are we in Your hand...
>Like the stone in the hand of the cutter- he grasps it at will and smashes it at will- so are we in Your hand…
>Like the curtain in the hand of the embroiderer-he makes it even at will and makes it uneven at will-so are we in Your hand...” 

Two things are interesting to me here. One is that whoever wrote this phrase, nestled among a long list of craft analogies for the relationship between humans and god, seems to believe even the embroiderer with the mastery and control of god might still make imperfect creations. Two is that a crafter with the skill of an omnipotent god might choose not to destroy an imperfect creation and start from scratch, but show it mercy instead. 

So here--although this year I sat in synagogue and heard this piyyut with some reluctance--is a liturgical reminder that the forgiveness and compassion the hole in my dress is asking for from me is analogous to the forgiveness and compassion I might ask from god, or if not god, from my community and from myself.
