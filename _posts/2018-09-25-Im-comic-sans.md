It is imperative that the header of this blog be in comic sans. Why, you ask? Because comic sans has character, and isn’t afraid to show it. One can always just use a default like Arial or Times New Roman, so every single time you see Comic Sans, someone cared enough to make that choice. Comic Sans says, “I may be a little corny, but I bring 100% effort every time.” This blog is a tribute to the unruly and imperfect -- to the adventure and epiphany that emerges from what is amateur and messy. So, in a way, is Comic Sans. 

Comic sans is maligned among designers, not for its own faults, but for what it represents. Mocking Comic Sans is a way of signaling “I’m a professional, and I’m in on the joke.” Many modern blog platforms don’t even offer Comic Sans, presumably to protect their users from the humiliation of innocently choosing a typeface that says to world, “I’m an amateur.” But, joke’s on us designers, because Comic Sans is an excellent typeface, both readable and friendly. It is even one of only a few widely available typefaces that uses [infant characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Typefaces_with_infant_variants), making it among the most accessible type faces for young people and people with reading disabilities.

So, once I realized the header of this blog could be in comic sans, I knew it must be. And once I knew it must be, I realized that it must [link to the the greatest piece of internet writing in history, McSweeney’s “I’m Comic Sans, Asshole.”](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/im-comic-sans-asshole) Now that I’ve decided to use Comic Sans, and I’ve discovered many modern blog platforms think they’re too good for Comic Sans, I’ve chosen to build my own website.  

Here, on the pages of this tribute to the unruly and imperfect, Comic Sans holds the position of honor. Go ahead and call me an amateur. I’ll be busy getting hammered with Papyrus.
