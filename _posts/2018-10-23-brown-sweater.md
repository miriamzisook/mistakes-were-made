This is the cubby in my closet where fabric scraps live. But a few weeks ago, this cubby also became home to an unfinished attempt at this McCall's pattern:

I started working on it in a terrible mood, hoping forcing a project would lift my spirits. Instead everything that could go wrong did go wrong. It was too small and tight to zip properly, but unzipped the zipper looked stupid. I didn't do the facings correctly. It was itchy. As my frustration built, I accidentally snipped a 2 inch hole in the shoulder. When I cut that hole I was so annoyed I couldn't imagine trying to finish it. I crumpled it and stashed it with my scraps. I was too mad at it, turns out, to even snap a photo. I went back to bed. 

Over the last few weeks I've taken it out to finish it a few times, but gotten frustrated immediately and put it away. Last Sunday I took it out again, but this time I found myself ready to tackle it. I decided to remove the zipper altogether, and allow it to be worn open as a drapey style cardigan instead. I placed a cute little patch and some sashiko style stitching around the hole, and I finally hemmed the sleeves. Worn with long sleeves under it it isn't too itchy after all. Actually, it's kind of cute, and I'll probably wear it sometimes.

What this project got me thinking about was what was in my way the day I started making it that kept me from finishing it, and every subsequent day I picked it up, got frustrated and stashed it away again? 

I usually come to a craft project with enthusiasm and energy. I'm excited to make the thing, I'm excited to wear the thing, and I'm a little bit restless. When I'm in that mode I want to finish it, and I want to finish it quickly. This time though, I was tired and grumpy. I just wanted to lie around in bed, but I chose to force a project instead. From that zone the resilience to hit an obstacle and keep going just wasn't there. In this case, mistakes were a symptom, not the problem. No part of me wanted to be working on this, and when I snipped that hole in the shoulder it was the signal I needed that I was forcing it and it was time to stop. I wasn't listening to myself. In this case, my resistance to fixing the sweater was simple, but also meaningful: I didn't want to do it and I needed a break. When I ignored that information and kept working as the sweater slowly became a mess, I made a mistake (a big cut out hole) I couldn't ignore. I decided to listen to that mistake and take a break. I came back to the project when I was ready and finished it successfully. 

This mistake was a really good teacher--it gave me a strong, clear reminder to listen to myself when something feels wrong by stopping, taking a break, and trusting that I will want to return to it when I am ready. The mistake wasn't in my way at all, it was just trying to help me get some rest.
