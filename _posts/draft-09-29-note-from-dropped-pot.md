Dear Miriam,

Good gracious! When you brought me home from the Cambridge Antiques Market, I never thought it would end like this. I was so looking forward to being purchased languishing there for years watching fussy chairs and battered toys and silly looking hats get picked up by new owners. I heard you talking about me to your new colleagues; you were excited about me not only because of my size, shape and weight, but because of what it meant to you to buy me on this outing. I don't know what an excursion even means, but your whole group's appreciationg for antiques was really somehting to behold. 

You said you loved carrying me, my heavy weight in your arms. Well, if you loved carrying me so freaking much, what were you thinking when you dropped me?! Iâ€™ve been around for decades, but I only had to live with you for a short month before my left handle was shattered. I'm sorry, I know I sound mad. Accidents happen or whatever. It's just I really had such high hopes. I was so excited to finally feel purpose again when I heard you talk about all about the sourdough breads and apple crisps you like to make, and especially thrilled when you used me to bake a bread the very day you bought me. Now, I am sitting here wondering if I'lll ever be lifted warmly from another oven. 

Please, please, repair me, I have so many more breads and apple crisps left to bake. 

Best regards,
Your injured dutch oven
