So far on this blog I've been writing about encountering mistakes I make in craft. Today, I'm turning my attention to how crafting can be a remedy for an emotional mistake, instead of the other way around. 

A few years ago, I made my mom a scarf out of a beautiful piece of Liberty of London pomegranate printed fabric. There were many, many reasons it was a thoughtful gift, and one I thought she would find special. In my memory, when I gave her the scarf, her reaction was… tepid. She said a lukewarm thank you, and she commented on how I didn’t do the right kind of hem. Fancy scarf hems are supposed to be hand slip-stitched, she pointed out, not machine hemmed. 

For the last few years, a small remnant of that fabric has been sitting in my scrap pile, practically radioactive in its symbolism of yearning and futility. I haven’t been able to use it, and I haven’t been able to throw it away. As the years have gone by my relationship with my mom has broken down further and further, to the point where I allow her practically no access to me. Still, this little scrap of fabric is just sitting there, daring me to find a way to make something with it.

A few weeks ago, an oportunity presented itself to use the fabric. Given a day to do a project related to imperfection and mistakes, I turned to this fabric as inspiration, with the goal of applying the idea of [kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi)--golden joinery, or making an object's scars a part of its beauty--to this tiny emotional disappointment. I wondered if I could make something for myself that I would actually enjoy and wear out of this sad little scrap of fabric. What emerged from that day is this scarf. I do find it beautiful and wearable, but more importantly, it allowed me to take the energy I spent on my mom and to turn it inward as an act of self-care instead. Through this project in a small way I feel my relationship to this story has changed from "here's a time my mom was really disappointing" to "here's a time I used my own creativity and emotional intelligence to treat myself kindly."

My favorite part? In homage to my mom's comment about how scarf hems should be hand-rolled, I trimmed one side of the scarf with a hand-stitched golden hem. 🖕
