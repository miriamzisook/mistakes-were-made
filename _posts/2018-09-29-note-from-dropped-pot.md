Dear Miriam,

When you brought me home from the Cambridge Antiques Market, I never thought it would end like this. Iâ€™ve been around for decades, but I only had to live with you for a month before my left handle was shattered. Please repair me, I have so many more breads and apple crisps left to bake. 

Best regards,
Your injured dutch oven
