Nothing says fall quite like apple crisp, especially apple crisp served outdoors. In this twist on a fall classic, I added the natural immune boosters dried leaves, dirt, and sand. Here’s the recipe:

**Ingredients:**
   * 4-6 medium apples. 
   * 1 tbs. lemon juice. 
   * 1 stick of melted butter or coconut oil.  
   * ½ c. granulated sugar. 
   * ½ c. brown sugar. 
   * 1 tsp. Cinnamon.  
   * 1 c. rolled oats. 
   * 1 c. flour. 

**Steps:**
1. Preheat oven to 350°
2. Locate a heavy, oven-safe pot with slippery handles
3. Slice apples and add to pot
4. Stir lemon juice and a sprinkle of cinnamon into the apples
5. Melt butter in a microwave safe bowl, or over a low heat on the stove
6. For the topping, add oatmeal, flour cinnamon, white sugar, and brown sugar and stir until combined. Mixture will be crumbly with large clumps.
7. Spread topping mixture over the apples
8. Bake at 350° for 45-60 minutes, until the apples are soft and top is golden brown
9. While carrying the apple crisp outside to be served, genty let it slip through your fingers and crash to the ground. Make sure it falls face down so it spills and comes in contact with the dirt. This is the most important step to make sure you get the full immune system benefit of this recipe. 
10. Gently scoop up the apple crisp and return it to the pan. The topping will be mixed in--that’s ok. The apple crisp will still taste delicious.
