Dear hole in my black chambray shirt dress,

According to Oprah you are a teacher to me. At first I wasn’t very welcoming, but now I recognize that you showed up to help me notice how unkindly I speak to myself when I make a mistake. You wanted me to notice that even though you are imperfect, I can still hold you in high regard, and I can still cherish you and be proud of you. You hoped that I could find a way to be glad for your quirks, and like you even better because you have character. You probably even want me to take this opportunity to wonder if I could evaluate myself more softly. 

I have chosen to say thank you by embellishing you with silver thread. In the Japanese Kintsugi tradition broken pottery is fixed with gold to celebrate the storied history of an object rather than to try to conceal it. When Kintsugi first emerged in Japan potters were sometimes accused of smashing their work on purpose, hungry for an opportunity to embellish it through the repair process. Instead of feeling regret about you, I’d like to thank you for the opportunity to add silver embroidery to an otherwise plain and simple garment. A visible reminder that we have the choice to conceal our storied pasts or to allow them to sparkle. 

With gratitude,
Miriam
