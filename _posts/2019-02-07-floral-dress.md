I consider myself a competent baker, but there are 2 things I consistently make poorly: brownies and pancakes. Allegedly two of the simplest and easiest things there are. Recently, when I lamented this to a friend, she suggested that perhaps it was because when I think something should be easy I am less careful than when I think it is going to be hard. Eureka! An explanation. 

Fast forward to me making a dead simple dress that I've made at least twice before, and completely screwing it up. First, I was lazy at the moment of cutting the pattern, and didn't check that I was using the right marks for where to cut the bodice (the dress is adapted from a shirt pattern, and to make it I cut the bodice horizontally about halfway down). Next, I forgot to fit the dress between basting together the pieces and topstitching them (a moment when it still would have been relatively easy to backtrack). I didn't notice the waistline was a full 2 inches from where it was supposed to be until I was almost done. To make matters worse, I was cutting too quickly with my rotary cutter and a clipped a little hole right smack in the middle of the skirt ([File under: There's another %$#@& hole in my dress?!](https://jolly-euler-5e7006.netlify.com/2018/09/26/theres-a-hole-in-my-dress.html)). This one I can live with--it's barely visible, and I did a cute visible mend of the word "oops" on there.

I was so annoyed, and so resistant to letting such a "simple" and "easy" project have even more of my time that I needed to step away for a few days. I considered a zillion workarounds (add a drawstring? Add a bow?) but ultimately, I knew what needed to be done. I completely disassembled the bodice, and remade it 2 inches shorter. It looks so much better. (On the outside; the inside is a mess--and you know what? I don't care! All my respect to people who finish their seams with tenderness and care, but I just can't always be bothered) 

There's something extra annoying about mistakes when you were expecting smooth sailing, but this served as a good reminder that even when I know what I'm doing, mistakes WILL be made. nd, even if that's the case, it couldn't hurt to slow down at the moments I most want to rush.
