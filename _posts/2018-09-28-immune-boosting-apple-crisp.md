Nothing says fall quite like apple crisp, especially apple crisp served outdoors. In this twist on a fall classic, I added the natural immune boosters dried leaves, dirt, and sand. Here’s the recipe:

Ingredients:
   * 4-6 medium apples. 
   * 1 tbs. lemon juice. 
   * 1 stick of melted butter or coconut oil.  
   * ½ c. granulated sugar. 
   * ½ c. brown sugar. 
   * 1 tsp. Cinnamon.  
   * 1 c. rolled oats. 
   * 1 c. flour.
