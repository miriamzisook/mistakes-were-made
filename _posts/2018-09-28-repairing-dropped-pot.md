I dropped this pot transporting apple crisp, and the handle cracked right off. It’s a great pot, the exact perfect size for a loaf of bread or an apple crisp. I was delighted when I found it in the antiques market. It is pleasing to hold in your arms to carry to a potluck. It has a cozy, snug-fitting lid to keep its contents warm and contained in transit. 

Here are several different approaches available for extending the life of this broken vessel. 

**Method 1: Ignoring**

The simplest approach to mending is ignoring. To use the ignoring method all you need to do is continue using the pot, disregarding its missing handle. 

**Method 2: Balancing**

The symmetry method is risky, but satisfying. To use the symmetry method you drop the pot from standing height onto it’s remaining handle. With luck, the handle will snap off, rendering your pot symmetrical and therefore perfect. Be careful though, there’s a risk the pot will break in a less desired way. 


**Method 3: Kintsugi**

Kintsugi is a traditional Japanese method of repair, where cracked pottery is repaired with gold leaf. For Kintsugi you will need [gold powdered pigment](https://www.amazon.com/Jacquard-JAC-JPX1656-Powdered-Pigment-Brilliant/dp/B000AP54AQ/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=5SFCC78XQ6G88ERNPGWT) and a strong adhesive, such as [JB Weld](https://www.jbweld.com/products/j-b-weld-twin-tube). To prepare the adhesive follow the directions on the package, then mix in gold gilding until the adhesive has a golden, metallic sheen. Apply the adhesive mix to the broken edges of the handle and the pot, and press together. Because it is a tricky item to clamp, prop heavy objects around the newly repaired handle to keep it in place as it dries. 

**Method 4: JB Welding**

The JB weld method is similar to the Kintsugi method, but without the gold leaf. This method might be preferable, because gold could weaken or interfere with the adhesive. According to the internet, people have added dry pigment to [JB weld](https://www.jbweld.com/products/j-b-weld-twin-tube) without incident, but I can’t find information on if it affects the strength or heat resistance. For the JB weld method, simply follow the directions for Kintsugi, but omit the gold gilding. 

**Method 5: Reinforcing**

Although JB weld is rated to 3960 PSI, you might feel instinctively disturbed by the idea of using glue to repair a heavy, metal object which you will be carrying hot from the oven, and which you have already dropped and broken once. If you’d like to seriously over-engineer a solution, consider reinforcing the repair with a tiny metal dowel pin. 

To reinforce with a pin you will need two thin metal dowel pins, a drill, and a drill bit of corresponding diameter. 
Begin by marking the position of a hole in the pot and handle where they meet on each side. 
Drill small holes, the diameter of the pin, into the marked position on the handle, and the pot. Make sure the holes are as deep as half the length of the pin. 
Press the pins into the holes and attach the handle to check the alignment. 
If the handle is properly aligned when attached with the pins, remove the pins. 
Apply [JB weld](https://www.jbweld.com/products/j-b-weld-twin-tube) to the handle and pot, then dip the pins in JB weld before re-inserting the pins. 
Allow to cure for 24 hours before using. 

**Method 6: Postponing**

Similar to the ignoring method, the future method requires that you delay a decision on your mending method so you can keep your options open. In the meantime, continue using the pot, disregarding its missing handle.
